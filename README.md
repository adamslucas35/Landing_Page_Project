# Landing_Page_Project
The Odin Project Assignment of creating my own landing page from scratch.

This assignment is to test my skills in creating a landing page from scratch based off of an image that I have downloaded. 
The overall goal is to recreate the 'ideal' landing page and then move on and create my own landing page for my personal portfolio and then go on and create other websites once I have more skills to back up the work. 
This assignment will be a test of knowledge, research and design skills, all put into one little project.
